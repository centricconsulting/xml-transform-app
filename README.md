# Centric XML Transform Utility
## Overview
Centric XML Transform Utility provides a Windows desktop interface to perform XML transformation using XSLT.  This application is compatible with **.NET Framework 4.5** and higher.

XSLT is a powerful transformation protocol to convert XML meta-data into an output format.  While commonly used to generate HTML, it can also be used to generate any other flat-file layout such as SQL and CSV.
